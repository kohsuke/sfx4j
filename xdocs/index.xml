<section name="About this project">
	<p>
	  This project allows you to embed an executable jar file into a single class/jar file.
	  The generated class file has the main method and it will launch the jar file.
	</p><p>
	  The motivation for this project was to create a pure-Java installer that forces
	  users to agree license terms before the installation starts. If we just use
	  the jar file as the installer, people can easily extract the contents from it
	  without ever agreeing with the license.
	</p><p>
	  To use this tool, run the jar file as follows:
	</p>
<pre>java -jar sfx4j.jar myjar.jar out/PackedClass.class</pre>
  <p>
    This will pack the <code>myjar.jar</code> file and generates <code>out/PackedClass.class</code> file.
    This class file can be executed as follows:
  </p>
<pre>java -cp out PackedClass</pre>
  <p>
    and this will run as if you run the following command:
  </p>
<pre>java -jar myjar.jar</pre>
   <p>
     To produce an executable jar file, execute the following:
   </p>
<pre>java -jar sfx4j.jar myjar.jar out/PackedClass.jar</pre>
